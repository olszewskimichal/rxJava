/**
 * Maybe is a special kind of Observable which can only emit zero or one item, and report an error if the computation fails at some point.
 *
 * In this regard, itâ€™s like a union of Single and Completable. All these reduced types, including Maybe, offer a subset of the Flowable operators. This means we can work with Maybe like a Flowable as long as the operation makes sense for 0 or 1 items.
